# Menu Cashier Page

---

A simple, practical, and easy-to-use menu cashier page for restaurant items. It allows adding and deleting items from the customer's order. It also includes an item management system for adding, deleting, and updating items.

Additionally, it has a database for tracking sales and expenses. Overall, I designed it to be easy to use. The styling might not be perfect, but the animations are really cool and beautiful. Overall, itâ€™s a good system for a standard restaurant.
